Tweerminal 0.1.0

This application was made for those who want an unexpected, new place to use Twitter, or those who prefer to edit an image on terminal rather than opening a visual interface for that :)

Don't expect much from this, it's just a basic app that lets you tweet, view your timeline, mentions (TODO), find your friends and some other basic tasks to be implemented on near future. I'm still figuring out what I want it to look like when ready, and what I want it to do.
I'm using a Python API (Tweepy) to handle all Twitter requests, so basically, all the hard coding is from Tweepy.

Please try it and send any suggestions to my gmail, twitter account or pm me here.

TODO list:

Add mentions support
Add follow/unfollow support
Add favorite/unfavorite tweet support
Improve method to display tweet and general app colors (improve "design")
Refactor code
Add error handling for everything (Application must NEVER close unless user tells it to do so)
Add support for other plattaforms
