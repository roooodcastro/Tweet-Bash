Tweet Bash 0.1.1

This application was made for those who want an unexpected, new place to use Twitter, or those who prefer to edit an image on terminal rather than opening a visual interface for that :)

Don't expect much from this, it's just a basic app that lets you tweet, view your timeline, mentions (TODO), find your friends and some other basic tasks to be implemented on near future. I'm still figuring out what I want it to look like when ready, and what I want it to do.
I'm using a Python API (Tweepy) to handle all Twitter requests, so basically, all the hard coding is from Tweepy.
